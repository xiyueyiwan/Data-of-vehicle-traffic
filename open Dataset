###Federal Highway Administration
Traffic Volume Trends is a monthly report based on hourly traffic count data reported by the States. These data are collected at approximately 4,000 continuous traffic counting locations nationwide and are used to estimate the percent change in traffic for the current month compared with the same month in the previous year.

Tennessee Dept of Transportation
An AADT traffic volume is used throughout the project planning process to provide projected volumes of traffic. It is based on a 24 hour, two directional count at a given location. This raw traffic volume is then mathematically adjusted for vehicle type, determined by an axle correction factor. Then this volume is statistically corrected by a seasonal variation factor that considers time of the year and day of the week.
